## How to Test

1. **Search**: Enter any term (e.g., "leather jacket") to get real Carousell results
2. **Caching**: Search for something, switch tabs, come back - results are preserved
3. **Favorites**: Click heart icons to add/remove favorites, check favorites tab
4. **Product Details**: Click on any search result to see detailed product view
5. **Currency**: Search for Singapore items to see SGD pricing (S$)

## Database Schema

The favorites are stored in the `favorite_items` table with:
- `external_id`: Product ID from Carousell
- `item_name`, `price`, `currency`, `platform`: Basic product info
- `metadata`: Additional details like condition, size, brand, description
- User association and timestamps

## API Integration

- **Endpoint**: `https://carousell.p.rapidapi.com/searchByKeyword`
- **Parameters**: `keyword` (from search input), `country=sg` (hardcoded)
- **Caching**: 5-minute cache to reduce API calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks to mock data if API fails
